We can achive the zero down time by following approaches

- Rooling Update Deployment

Our Environment has hundred of server when there is a new version to deploy we don't have to bring down all servers or one time deplyment 

So we can with rooling deployment approach, in this approach we pic few servers int he group deploy the code bring the servers up 

and pick next few deploy the code and bring the servers up. and repeate this process until we deploy new application code on all the environements.

- Blue Green Deployment

Blue-green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called Blue and Green.

At any time, only one of the environments is live, with the live environment serving all production traffic. For this example, Blue is currently live and Green is idle.

As you prepare a new version of your software, deployment and the final stage of testing takes place in the environment that is not live. 

In this example, Green. Once you have deployed and fully tested the software in Green, you switch the router so all incoming requests now go to Green instead of Blue. Green is now live, and Blue is idle.

This technique can eliminate downtime due to app deployment. In addition, blue-green deployment reduces risk.

if something unexpected happens with your new version on Green, you can immediately roll back to the last version by switching back to Blue.
